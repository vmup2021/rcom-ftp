## Conclusion
In this experiment we just configured the DNS to our hosts in the network. To accomplish this task we went to the file "/etc/resolve.conf" of each host 
and added the DNS server as "nameserver 172.16.2.1". In our logs we could see the DNS packets that are exchaged, which is basically a query and a response,
where the protocol resolves a human readable name into an IP address that the computer understand.
